Description
-----------

The Event Poll plugin can only be used together with the Event Calendar plugin.

The Event Poll plugin allows to invite other site members to an event and to set up a poll asking the invitees for date and time the event should be held.

Note: this plugin is still somewhat "raw". The UI might feel a bit unpolished and most importantly editing an existing event poll is not yet fully implemented. You can edit an existing event poll already but all previous selections (event length, schedule slots and invitees) will be reset and you will have to make all the selections again. The plan is to make the event poll editing fully working for sure. But it's a question of time available to work on it - if you want to contribute feel free to make a PR will the necessary code ;-).


Installation
------------

1. If you have installed a previous version of the Event Poll plugin plugin disable the plugin in the admin section of your site and then remove the event_poll folder from the mod directory of your Elgg installation,
2. Copy the event_poll folder into the mod directory of your Elgg installation,
3. Enable the Event Poll plugin plugin in the admin section of your site.
